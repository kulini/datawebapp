# Spring 4 Project 
This project is aimed at developing a web application on a cloud service that is accessible to the public. It will have graphs and plots that are interactive and will visualize trends of a car advertisement dataset 

Pandas was used to preprocess the data and prepare it for further analysis. While the Plotly Express library was used to plot histograms of different variables to reveal insights within the car advertisement dataset.
